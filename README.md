# Contact Manager (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JS)

Simple interactive contact manager that stores contacts in the browser `localStorage`.

Files:
- `index.html` - main UI
- `css/styles.css` - small custom styles
- `js/script.js` - add/edit/delete/list logic

Usage:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) OR serve with a simple static server:

```bash
# from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```

2. Use the form to add contacts. Edit or delete contacts using the buttons in the list. Data persists in your browser.
